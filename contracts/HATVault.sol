/** @title A HAT vault which holds the funds for a specific project's bug 
* bounties
* @author hats.finance
* @notice The HAT vault can be deposited into in a permissionless maner using
* the vaultâ€™s native token. When a bug is submitted and approved, the bounty 
* is paid out using the funds in the vault. Bounties are paid out as a
* percentage of the vault. The percentage is set according to the severity of
* the bug. Vaults have regular safety periods (typically for an hour twice a
* day) which are time for the committee to make decisions.
*
* In addition to the roles defined in the HATVaultsRegistry, every HATVault 
* has the roles:
* Committee - The only address which can submit a claim for a bounty payout
* and set the maximum bounty.
* User - Anyone can deposit the vault's native token into the vault and 
* recieve shares for it. Shares represent the user's relative part in the
* vault, and when a bounty is paid out, users lose part of their deposits
* (based on percentage paid), but keep their share of the vault.
* Users also receive rewards for their deposits, which can be claimed at any
* time.
* To withdraw previously deposited tokens, a user must first send a withdraw
* request, and the withdrawal will be made available after a pending period.
* Withdrawals are not permitted during safety periods or while there is an 
* active claim for a bounty payout.
*
* Bounties are payed out distributed between a few channels, and that 
* distribution is set upon creation (the hacker gets part in direct transfer,
* part in vested reward and part in vested HAT token, part gets rewarded to
* the committee, part gets swapped to HAT token and burned and/or sent to Hats
* governance).
*
* This project is open-source and can be found at:
* https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts
*
* @dev HATVault implements the ERC4626 standard
